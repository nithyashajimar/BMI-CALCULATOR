The BMI Calculator is a simple web-based application built using Python (Flask), HTML, and CSS.
It allows users to input their height (in cm) and weight (in kg) to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) and identify their health category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese).
This project demonstrates basic Flask web development, form handling, and dynamic content rendering using templates.
